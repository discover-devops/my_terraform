#  Understanding Dependencies in Terraform – Step by Step

Terraform follows a **graph-based dependency model** to figure out the correct order in which resources should be **created, updated, or destroyed**. There are **two types of dependencies**:

---

##  1. Implicit Dependencies

###  Definition:

Terraform **automatically figures out** the correct order of resources by examining **references in your code**. If resource A refers to resource B, then Terraform knows that **B must be created first**.

###  Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name = "my-sg"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami                    = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web_sg.id] # <-- Reference
}
```

###  How Terraform interprets this:

* Terraform **sees** that `aws_instance.web_server` **depends** on `aws_security_group.web_sg`.
* It will **create the Security Group first**, then launch the EC2 instance.
* You do not need to manually specify this order — Terraform **builds a dependency graph** internally.

---

##  2. Explicit Dependencies using `depends_on`

###  Definition:

Use the `depends_on` meta-argument when:

* Resources do **not directly reference each other**,
* But you **want to enforce an order** because of a **logical dependency** or timing issue.

###  Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket = "my-log-bucket"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Force Terraform to create the S3 bucket before this instance
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.logs]
}
```

###  Why this is useful:

Even though the EC2 instance **doesn’t use the S3 bucket directly**, maybe your startup script (user\_data) uploads logs to S3.

Without `depends_on`, Terraform may **launch the EC2 instance before the bucket exists**, leading to **runtime errors**.

---

##  How Terraform Builds the Dependency Graph

Terraform constructs a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** from all your resource definitions.

* **Nodes** = individual resources (e.g., `aws_instance`, `aws_subnet`, etc.)
* **Edges** = dependencies between them (from references or `depends_on`)
* Terraform **walks through the graph** in topological order during apply and destroy phases.

##  Practical Real-World Examples

---

###  Example 1: Implicit Dependency in VPC Setup

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id   # Implicit dependency
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}
```

Terraform knows:
 `aws_vpc.main` must be created **before** `aws_subnet.public`.

---

###  Example 2: Explicit Dependency in Bootstrap Sequence

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "rds" {
  engine         = "mysql"
  instance_class = "db.t2.micro"
  allocated_storage = 20
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Even if the app does not reference the DB, we want DB to come up first
  depends_on = [aws_db_instance.rds]
}
```

###  Why?

Because your app server might try to connect to the database on boot.

---

###  Example 3: User Data Dependency on S3 Bucket

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_config" {
  bucket = "my-config-bucket"
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              aws s3 cp s3://${aws_s3_bucket.app_config.bucket}/config.json /etc/app/config.json
              EOF

  # Even though the bucket name is interpolated, use explicit depends_on to be safe
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.app_config]
}
```

Even though `aws_s3_bucket.app_config.bucket` is referenced, **user\_data runs at runtime**, not at apply time — so we explicitly enforce the dependency.

---

##  When You Must Use `depends_on`

| Scenario                                         | Use `depends_on`? | Why                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| One resource references the output/ID of another | ❌ No              | Terraform auto-detects                  |
| No direct reference, but logical order matters   | ✅ Yes             | Enforces order                          |
| Using `user_data` to fetch data from S3/RDS/etc. | ✅ Yes             | Prevent boot-time errors                |
| Creating IAM roles before attaching policies     | ✅ Yes             | Role attachment needs the role to exist |
| Null resources or local-exec scripts             | ✅ Yes             | Execution depends on timing             |

##  Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                                      | Problem                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `depends_on` **everywhere**                            | Makes your code rigid and hard to maintain              |
| Assuming `user_data` dependency is handled via interpolation | Interpolation happens at **plan time**, not **runtime** |
| Ignoring edge cases like `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`    | Attachments require explicit dependency on the IAM Role |

---

##  Best Practices

* **Prefer implicit dependencies**: Reference resource attributes (e.g., `.id`, `.arn`) wherever possible.
* **Use `depends_on` only when necessary**: Prefer to avoid unless needed for runtime guarantees.
* **Visualize dependencies** with:

  ```sh
  terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
  ```
* **Write comments** near `depends_on` so others understand why it's required.

##  Final Recap

| Concept                 | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implicit Dependency** | Handled automatically via attribute references       |
| **Explicit Dependency** | Use `depends_on` for logical or runtime dependencies |
| **Execution Plan**      | Terraform creates a DAG and walks through it         |
| **Don’t Overuse**       | Over-using `depends_on` adds unnecessary complexity  |
